What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A directory is version-trackable once repository is initialised. This allows commits to be made in the repo.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area may only contain a fraction of the working directory that you want to commit. It is not commited yet, so files in your staging area is not a part of your repository.
