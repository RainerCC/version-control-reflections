When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are collaborating with other contributors or when you have to sync your work across multiple computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If Git does it automatically, it might pull new commits from the remote that you are not ready to handle locally, when you are in the midst of editing your local versioin.
